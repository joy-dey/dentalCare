                        A dental implant is like an artificial tooth root used in dentistry to support crowns and bridges that replace a tooth or group of teeth. Dental Implant is a titanium screw like structure, which is anchored into the jawbones and functions similar to a
                        natural tooth. Dental Implants can be placed in areas where natural teeth are either lost due to decay or trauma or when a tooth cannot be saved and has to be extracted. Dental Implants have two main treatment phases. Firstly,
                        the Dental Implant is placed into the jawbone. Secondly, the Dental Implant has a tooth like crown placed on it. These two stages have been traditionally performed with between 3-6 months healing in-between. Where appropriate,
                        the two stages are now being performed at the same time. White Pearl Dental Clinic specializes in Dental Implants in Agartala at affordable cost.

                        Dental extraction is the removal of a tooth from the mouth. There are many reasons for taking tooth extraction treatment such as tooth decay that has destroyed enough tooth structure where restoration is impossible. Extractions of impacted or problematic
                        wisdom teeth are routinely performed in our clinic. We provide extraction treatment of some permanent teeth to make space for orthodontic treatment.

                        We at White Pearl Dental Care offer the Best Root Canal Treatment in Agartala. Root canals are valuable dental procedures used to treat and preserve teeth with badly infected roots. The pulp is the live portion of the tooth that extends into the root
                        and contains nerve endings and tissues. When it becomes infected, patients can experience pain, swelling and even total tooth loss unless treated. Root canals remove the damaged parts of the tooth and infected root. In some cases,
                        an antibiotic is prescribed to help prevent further infection within the tooth. The organic portion of the tooth that remains may be restored by teeth Capping or crown that provides a natural appearance and normal tooth function.
                        Many patients associate root canals with pain and discomfort but local anesthetics and advancements in modern dentistry have made root canals highly tolerable procedures that are often no less comfortable than getting a standard
                        filling. Upon completion, a restored tooth that has undergone a root canal will blend in with surrounding teeth – virtually undetectable to the average eye.

                    <p class="text-justify">Advances in dentistry have made many improvements in dentures. Now dentures are more natural looking and comfortable than they used to be. But they still may feel strange at first. In the beginning, your dentist may want to see you
                        often to make sure the dentures fit perfectly. Over time, your mouth will change and dentures may need adjustment or may need to be replaced. Be sure to let your dentist handle these adjustments.</p>

                        You might have seen kids wearing braces or wires on their teeth. They are in fact going through this treatment called "orthodontic treatment". This treatment corrects the irregularities of your teeth. For example, if you have a bad bite because of crowed
                        or crooked teeth. Teeth in irregular position lead to an undesirable appearance, and smile. To correct such problems, one has to go through this treatment. Wires and brackets help to move teeth from their current position to the
                        correct position. Orthodontic treatment helps in improving the oral health condition and facial bone development too. Orthodontic treatment not only improves the look of your teeth, it may prevent bigger dental problems from developing
                        later in life.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        If you are missing one or more teeth, your dental surgeon may suggest fitting a prosthetic device to fill the gap, that is, a dental bridge. A dental bridge is a type of dental prosthesis which literally bridges the gap between two teeth. If you have
                        lost one or two teeth due to decay or because of an accident, a bridge can make your smile complete again. Traditional tooth bridges use the adjacent teeth as anchors for the prosthesis. The prosthesis used for a fixed bridge consists
                        of a crown on either side and one or two pontics (artificial teeth) in the middle. The crowns are hollow and fit over the neighboring teeth to secure the bridge in place. In order for the crowns to fit properly, the anchor teeth
                        must be filed down from their original size as part of the dental bridge procedure. These two teeth have to be strong enough to support the bridge and take the extra biting pressure. Dentists may perform root canal treatment on
                        the anchor teeth before removing the necessary amount of enamel. The main drawback to a fixed bridge is having to 'sacrifice' two healthy teeth. If you later decide to replace your bridge with an implant, the adjacent teeth will
                        require crowns since removal of enamel is permanent.
